# 📚 Multi-Language Practice Repository

This repository is a **personal coding playground** containing practice files, experiments, and learning exercises across **multiple programming languages and technologies**.

It is designed to grow continuously as I explore new languages, frameworks, tools, and concepts.

## 🧠 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice programming concepts
- Learn new languages and tools
- Store experiments, drafts, and learning code
- Maintain a single, organized place for hands-on coding
- Track progress over time using Git

This repository is **not focused on production-ready projects**, but rather on **learning, experimentation, and skill development**.

## 📁 Repository Structure (Flexible)

The structure is intentionally kept flexible.  
Folders may be organized by:

- Language  
- Topic  
- Concept  
- Experiment  
- Date or practice session  

Example (may change over time):

```text

│── c/
│── cpp/
│── python/
│── web/
│   ├── html/
│   ├── css/
│   └── js/
